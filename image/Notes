Quantize each subband choosing a different quantization step (do not
quantize the low frequency image) (see TD 1). Justify your choice.

# 2. Quantization
for R in range(1,8):
    quantized_subbands = []
    print("Bitrate R: " + str(R))
    for band in subbands:

        # quantize subband with fixed bit rate R
        quant_band = quantize_image(band, R)

        # calculate bucket for current subband
        L = pow(2, R)
        bucket = abs(band.max() - band.min()) / L

        # save band min and bucket size
        arr_min.append(band.min())
        arr_bucket.append(bucket)

        # save quantized subband
        quantized_subbands.append(quant_band)


        print("Entropy before quant = ", entropy(band))
        print("Entropy after quant = ", entropy(quant_band))
        print("Ratio = ", entropy(band)/entropy(quant_band))


And we choose R = 5 for the first three bands (level 1 decomposition) and R = 6 for the other three, because they provide a reasonable compression ratio (not too much information lost)
